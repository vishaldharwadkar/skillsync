## 📅 Stage 1 – Planning & Architecture (Current)
**Goal:** Define the vision, features, and technical blueprint.
- Create GitHub repository & initial structure
- Document project vision, goals, and scope
- Write system architecture (`ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- Identify core features (MVP)
- Prepare learning notes (`SKILLSYNC_NOTES.md`)
- Plan technology stack integration (React + .NET + Python ML)

**Deliverables:**
- Repo created with `/docs`, `/frontend`, `/backend`, `/ml` folders
- High-level architecture diagram
- Feature list & MVP defined
